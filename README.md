# SmartQuery

SmartQuery integrates a database and a LLM, and provides a set of APIs to interact with them.

## Available Scripts

In the `./ui` directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

UI would be started in dev mode on port 3000, and you can now view it in the browser at http://localhost:3000

### Samples DBs

Smart Query comes with a set of sample databases that includes both schema and data for various dialects to try out the features.
